  <title>Gazoo - PMPVsAustralia</title>
  <description>G&quot;day Mate, how ya goin&quot; ?It&quot;s Sunday across most of the world, and I&quot;m doing whatevz&quot; to do a show for you. A down&quot;n&quot;under show. Crazy right? A new continent. What have I been up to? Well - I&quot;ve been doing a bit to PlanMixPlay, and soon we might have some video.And when I say soon, I mean not soon, because I&quot;m kind of a moron.If you&quot;re still reading, you might as well tune in and listen, cause it&quot;ll be way better than the lame jokes you&quot;d find in this text.</description>
