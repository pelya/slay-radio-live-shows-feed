  <title>Gazoo - PMPVsHamburg</title>
  <description>It&quot;s the middle of August, and I can barely fathom that we&quot;ve gotten this far into 2015. It&quot;s nearly 2016. And I&quot;m living with my parents. While doing a Commodore 64 themed show in the basement. By most standards, this would be classified as &quot;not the means to an end&quot;, but the actual &quot;end&quot; itself. Seriously...But while I&quot;m writing this here, a part of me wonders who even bothers reading these texts. More importantly, why do I bother writing them? I mean, even big-time shows like old Tonight show, or as I like to call it &quot;The Conan &quot;o Brian show hosted by Jay Leno&quot; (heh) probably had this text that nobody read. Written by an intern. While on the way to pick up breakfast. For another intern.Seriously, I&quot;m cranking out A-grade material here, and when will it be blessed by living eyes? Not after I click this &quot;Create Show&quot; button I&quot;m pretty sure...</description>

  <title>Gurt - Radio Awesome</title>
  <description>It&quot;s back! The usual show is happening. I can&quot;t think of a spiel right now as I&quot;ve not slept or ate in 24 hours. Rest assured, it will happen, or I&quot;ll eat myself!</description>
