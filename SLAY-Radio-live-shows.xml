  <title>Gazoo - PMPVsHamburg</title>
  <description>In the mortal words of Ahr-nuld Schwazzenejjer, I&quot;m back. Yes. It&quot;s often misquoted as I&quot;ll be back, a common misconception.My excursion to the north has ended prematurely, which is a little sad given that it means I will/am not attending the Gathering, but to make up for it in my own little way, I will be closing out the weekend of the Gathering with a show. This time at a much later slot.This of course does put the show a bit out of listening range from the previous continent I broadcast from, and yes - I am counting Asia as a separate content, despite the fact that it is a landmass connected to Europe.So tune in, or don&quot;t, either way, there are a few surprises on the way. Mainly, a little improved chat system that will hopefully keep improving as time goes on.</description>
