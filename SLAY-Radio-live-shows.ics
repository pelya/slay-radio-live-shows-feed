SUMMARY:KraxxUltima - Cracked Impromptu Industries
DESCRIPTION:Well , here's a little extra show to make up for an extra busy summer week, since no regular show was made this time. And hopefully the Behringer won't bring too much noise. Request your Commodore tunes as per usual as you wish =)  Have fun!   (and Stone Oakvalley (sids/mods) seems to be down for some reason.)
