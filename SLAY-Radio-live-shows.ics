SUMMARY:KraxxUltima - The Ultimate Crack
DESCRIPTION:How are you all doing?  Hope everyone made it safely through Halloween, and that the kids didn't terrorize you too much with their demands for candy, tricks and other nonsense.  Anyway ,Kraxx shall soothe any eventual wounds this autumn causes by causing more. Well, in musical form anyhow.Make your Commodore requests and listen to a semi-normal swedish northlander talking in between da songs ;)
