SUMMARY:Boz and Kate - BBB
DESCRIPTION:It's the Taint of the Weeku2122 again, so it's time for Boz to babble complete bollocks in between your requests. But you don't want that - you want a gorgeous lady to take the nonsense away. Thankfully we have Kate to add or subtract (make your own mind up) from the bollocks! All aboard the Train-Wreck, WOO WOOH!
