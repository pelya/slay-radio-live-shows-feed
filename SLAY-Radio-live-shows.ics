SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - The TOP2 Challenge
DESCRIPTION:Hello Everyone! After all of you made sure you voted for your personal Remixer of the Year 2018 candidates, we thought we invite you for a challenge. In case you would have to go to an unhabited island, which remixes of all time would you take with you, if you could only take 2? Don't worry, you have a life-time supply of battery power that will only power your mp3 player, so you're safe!So we want you to name and request your all-time favourite C64-or Amigaremixes! (both can be C64 or Amiga - the choice is yours!)Go ahead, think it through carefully and choose! We can't wait to hear your own personal TOP2! :) Join the fun and SLAY tuned!
