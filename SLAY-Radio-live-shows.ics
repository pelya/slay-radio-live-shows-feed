SUMMARY:Bozzy and the Bint - BBKB
DESCRIPTION:It's the Taint of the Weeku2122 again, so it's time for Boz to utter complete bollocks in between your requests. Thankfully, Kate is around to translate some of the nonsense into fuzzy logic - well, at least Scottish logic. All aboard the Train-Wreck, WOO WOOH!

SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsGrievances
DESCRIPTION:It's the weekend! Or rather - it will be. Chances you're reading this on the weekend are roughly 2/7 - but honestly, who's counting?I am. On you! To join me this Sunday and listen to me on my soapbox, c-64 remixes coming out of your speakerboxes, and perhaps one last jab at a former champ who used to box.Now that I've sufficiently run that tasteless box joke into the ground, how about we all just go about our business, good? Good.
