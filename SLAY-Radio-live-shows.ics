SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - Synth-estesia?
DESCRIPTION:Hi Everyone, Slowly, very slowly we are opening the door of summer and we hope that you are happy about it too, but still safe of course!Some of us have a special condition called Synesthesia, which means that our brain creates mysterious automatic connection between a color and a track. This is what we will talk about a bit today. Any of you who feels similar, can enter the game and share the colors of the tracks we play - ziona certainly will. These experiences are usually unique and no one hears/sees these colors the same way, this is why it can be even more interesting :) Looking forward to hear your impressions! Join us and SLAY tuned!
