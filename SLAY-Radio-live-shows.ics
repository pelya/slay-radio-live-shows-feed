SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - Sci-fi Tuesday
DESCRIPTION:Hello Dear Slayers,Long time no TCP! Okay, it's been only 2 weeks. But now we are back, and we picked a favourite topic of ours for this Tuesday, which most of you might be interested too - Sci-Fi!So we might talk about movies, series, books and even games related to that (in the latter we have less experience, but who knows - for example I like Space invaders - ziona :)And you can request your favourite remixes as well (also, there are plenty of them out there related to space games, but you can ask for anything this time ;)Make some space in your calendar and come SLAY along with us!
