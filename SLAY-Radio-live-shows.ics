SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsYouTubeCareers
DESCRIPTION:Hello you lovely individual,It's time for another show, and this time we'll be delving back again into my mind regarding YouTube, and the growing trend of youths throwing their caution (and future) to the wind and opting to become full-time YouTubers.Smart? Dumb? Wise? Insane?Some of these questions will be answered!And as always, a plethora of Commodore 64 classics.Be there and be square!
