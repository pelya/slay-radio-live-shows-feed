SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsFutures
DESCRIPTION:We're through the looking glass here people. The visuals have begun and they're not likely to stop any time soon. In fact, if I can manage, I might even take things a step further, but that depends a lot on how much free time I manage to scrape together.All I'm saying is that these pixels don't just assemble themselves.In addition to that - c64 stuff and general hijinx as always.Topics include the future.
