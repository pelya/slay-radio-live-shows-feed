SUMMARY:ziona - The Bozzzssspecial!
DESCRIPTION:Dear Slayers,In the upcoming show you can welcome our most prominent, amazing, beautiful, smart, awesome Nobel Prize winning broadcaster (for discovering the DNA of radio)! And he's gonna be my interview guest on air! You can harass him with any questions, and perhaps, maybe, you can learn a lot more about him than in those 12 years of his SLAY Radio career being the Chief Annoyance Officer! ;)Don't forget to prepare your requests too, otherwise we have to play his requests and I won't skip the opportunity to annoy him with his most favourite auto-tuned remix too! SLAY tuuuned! =)

SUMMARY:ziona & Slaygon - From First to Last (The Contrast remixshow)
DESCRIPTION:Hello Everyone! Have you ever wondered how your favourite remixers started to make their very first pieces? This time, if you tune in, you'll have an opportunity to have a look at the path they walked from their first remix ever to their last ones! I got the idea from the Function demoparty, where they played well-known groups' first and last demos, right after each other, and it gives you a very nice contrast and the discovery that no one was born as a remixer and everyone started somewhere! And Slaygon will join me on this journey, so fun is guaranteed! :) SLAY tuned, and request no songs, but remixers this time! =)
