SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - Octobear with us
DESCRIPTION:Hello Everyone,...and sorry for the pun. We heard somewhere recently that continuous pun-ning might be a sign of some serious brain damage. Our bad! Anyway, a show is ahead of us again, where we sit back, relax and play tunes. This time Slaygon does not have to stress about technical details either :) So, we will be as chilled as possible. Wind down the week with us and SLAY tuned!
