SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsMajoran
DESCRIPTION:Peepulz! Wasssaaaaaaaaaaaah! Erm... Ahem... I mean... Hallo fine esteemed gentlemans and gentleladys.You might have noticed a slight change in show name. No, I haven't left Australia, so I'm still very much Vs. with Australia, but I've recently made one of the best decisions ever by actually investing a little bit of money in myself and PMP. In other words, I now officially have a small development space dedicated to PlanMixPlay at Majoran Distilleries. I'll be spending a few months polishing up PlanMixPlay and getting it to the next important milestone.With a little luck, I may get to do a show on the re-vamped version here in Australia. Fingers crossed!Anyway - This blurb was supposed to be about the show - so uhm. It's a C-64 show. Listen to it. This text commands you to.
