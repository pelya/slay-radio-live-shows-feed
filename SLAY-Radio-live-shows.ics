SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsAdelaide
DESCRIPTION:After a brief hiatus, PMPVsThing is back in full force. I probably should check whether or not my microphone survived the trip across the planet, but sometimes surprises can be fun!What'll be on the agenda? Well - perhaps a little bit about how different Australia is to Europe and perhaps also just a little bit about the C-64 as well.As you can probably already tell, it'll be a bit of a hap-hazard spontaneous show. So same as usual!
