SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - The Last Ninja show
DESCRIPTION:Hello All the Ninjas around here! Special show coming up. We gonna dedicate an entire show to the remixes made of the Last Ninja series, but do not be afraid - it doesn't mean we gonna play the same melodies for an hour =) We go subtune by subtune in order of the SIDs, and pick one excellent remix of each of them, from Last Ninja 1 to 3, if time will be on our side (if it takes longer than three hours, well... we consider to do a second take of it later :) Join us, and if you request, please ask for your favourite Last Ninja tune this time! Again - we play one of each subtune, so it might be yours =) SLAY tuned!
