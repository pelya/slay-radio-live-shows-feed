SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsTBA2
DESCRIPTION:Good day to you internet person.Right off the bat, yes the PMPVsTBA is/was/continues to be a previously made amusing gag. But it fits the bill in terms of pre-preemptively announcing something you're perhaps not entirely ready to announce.One thing is for certain however. There will be a show this Sunday and we'll be talking about some things. Important things?What things you say? Errr... Don't ask, don't tell?See you Sunday!
