SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsTestingTheFifth
DESCRIPTION:PMPVsTestingtheFifthEven I wouldn't have expected a total of five testing shows be required to iron out what I'd consider to be the most critical of issues, but here we are.Live video/chat system available on www.planmixplay.comSo why tune in this Sunday?It's simple - because I'll use reverse psychology and tell you not to, if you don't. So you will. See? Simple.In addition, to that, here's a little taste of the menu:- Classic SID remixes- One of a kind c-64 live style chat- The realities of rental life- PlanMixPlay moving forward- Neir: Automata- Various minor topics- Possibly (hopefully) the big finale I've been promising for a whileFor those wondering upfront - it is going to be a solo show which means you get 100% unadulterated me.
