SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsHiatus
DESCRIPTION:Hey.Friend.Yeah, ok, acquaintance. I mean... Look. It's been a while, and I'm sorry for not calling. Or texting. But look, it was a good run, wasn't it? I mean - I held it together for about 3-4 months with a weekly show.At least... I think I held it together ok. Yeah, sometimes interests wane and other things come in-between.Such is the life of a celeb-c64-radio-show streamer man. Constantly battling down fans and beating off love-sick fans. If - btw - you see any, just let them know where and when to tune in.Anyway... Let's catch up. I'll do better. I promise. Ok? Ok.
