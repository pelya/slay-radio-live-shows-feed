SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsMusitec
DESCRIPTION:Hello fellow internet dweller,Yes - there's been a little bit of a hiatus, and there's bound to continue to be one or two more as I get settled here on the other side of the planet, but those are the breaks. I trust you will excuse the somewhat messy transition, as long as there's a show or two to hold you over.Speaking of hold over shows - this would be one of those. There's no current agenda as such, but if I manage I'll be sure to squeeze in the time to write up a script. No promises though.Hope to see you on Sunday!
