SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsGrievances
DESCRIPTION:It's the weekend! Or rather - it will be. Chances you're reading this on the weekend are roughly 2/7 - but honestly, who's counting?I am. On you! To join me this Sunday and listen to me on my soapbox, c-64 remixes coming out of your speakerboxes, and perhaps one last jab at a former champ who used to box.Now that I've sufficiently run that tasteless box joke into the ground, how about we all just go about our business, good? Good.
