SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - Logging in again
DESCRIPTION:After a long pause, we are back, and from the second Thuesday of July everything will be back to normal and we will be on air weekly. As some of you know it, we had an unfortunate reason to stay away from broadcasting, since I lost my Dad in the near past and I was around my family whenever I could. He was the reason I got my interest very early on towards computers and sci-fis. He got all my computers in my child and teenagehood in fact. His non-stop optimism was cheering up everyone around him. Without him I would not be who I am, and I would not be wherever I am right now. There won't be any concept, just a free-flow show, as it is, and we will see, where it goes. Take care! /ziona
