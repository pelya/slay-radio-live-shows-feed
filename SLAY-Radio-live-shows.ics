SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsPMP2
DESCRIPTION:I had hoped I could tease some stuff here and declare success, but despite a valiant effort PMP2 is still just beyond reach. I'll do my best tomorrow and see if I can manage, but I'm quite wary of using PMP2 without it being just tested a teeny tiny bit.Regardless - a show there will certainly be.
