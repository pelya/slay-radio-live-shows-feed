SUMMARY:Gurt - Radio Awesome
DESCRIPTION:I'm back from holiday, so it's time to inflict another show on people! Join me for the usual mumbo jumbo. I'd say summat fancy here but like, it's only two days, if I waste time trying to think of what to put here it'll be 12 hours instead, so yeah. Show.

SUMMARY:Gohanks - Retro For Sure
DESCRIPTION:Once again not in the usual time slot, but I said it might be expected last time. Anyway weekend is a good time to do a live show and this time you won't even have to wake up early, so we can party without any worries! Join the fun! This week we're talking about Monkey Island.

SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsHamburg
DESCRIPTION:What? Huh? Who? Gazoo?Yes. I've been off the air for the past 2 months. Not necessarily happy about that, but sometimes life gets in the way and in this case, a particularly curious situation stopped me from broadcasting. Was it dingos chewing on the cable? Kangaroos boxing me out of house and home? Do not fret - all will be revealed this Sunday.Well... Most things will. Ok - some things. Alright fine, one or two tiny tid-bits may. Perhaps. Possibly. If you're lucky.But I should be so lucky! Spend the Sunday evening with me - and I'll tell you all about the exciting future! I promise, I'll play some tunes too!
