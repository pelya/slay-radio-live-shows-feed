SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - The Metallic Show
DESCRIPTION:Hello Slayers!December has started, and with it comes the hardcore Christmas season. Jingle bells everywhere, and most of us are probably a little fed up with all the Christmas songs you hear on the streets or in the shopping malls. This is why we have the cure for you, at least for an evening: the metal remix show, which can help your frustration or just help you to relax a little. Please, request metal remixes only this time, be it C64 or Amiga, let the guitars rock for the entire evening! We are looking forward to hear from you and your choice of tracks! SLAY tuned! ;)
