SUMMARY:KraxxUltima - Krax plays chill Trax in the heat
DESCRIPTION:So , pure desert warmth up in at least northern Sweden right now. It's silly hot and dry, but seing as we're sailing the unsinkable ship i'm sure the Ocean soundwaves will cool us down abit. Tune in and request lots of great C64 or Amiga songs, and mix yer favorite summer drinks if you need. Have Fun!

SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - Tuesday lemonade with Citrus
DESCRIPTION:Ahoi Everyone! Want a refreshing sweet and sour lemonade with ice in the middle of this hot summer? We certainly do, and because citrus fruits are the best to flavour it, we'll have a guest interview as well, with the guy who narrated Ziona's intros right from the start of her broadcasting!The Voice himself will talk about his everyday and demoscene life since he is a programmer as well. And amongst all those things, you can prepare your requests! SLAY tuned!
