SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsContinuousDevelopments
DESCRIPTION:Yes indeed. It's that time of the week. I've been toiling and slaving behind the curtains in order to bring you only the very best in last-moment effort.Astound, at how I wait until the very last seconds prior to the show, before coming up with compelling content.Gasp, at how I look up basic facts which could easily been prepared in advance.And finally, shock at how I make light of it all, in a vain attempt to cover up my lack of professionalism.
