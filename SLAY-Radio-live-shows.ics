SUMMARY:Gazoo - PmpVsXMas Part Two of Two
DESCRIPTION:Given that it's Christmas, I think it's appropriate to give the gift of prediction! A whole two shows from PlanMixPlay and me, and one of them scheduled more than a week in advance! Gasp!To heighten the excitement, the shows will not only be far apart in a time sense, but also spatially. 16,175.76 km to be exact. While it does mean the visual portion is a little in question for the second part, being I'm not too sure of the upstream in the second location, it may just end up being a classic 'Audio only' show. Who can say? Time will tell!Tune in to hear a bit about the Fallout franchise, some Immortal and PhasedBased stuff, and whatever else comes to mind at the time!See you there and stay square!Gazoo
