SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsPMP2Again
DESCRIPTION:Hey yall,I got so sad seeing all those !shows being triggered on EFnet #SlayRadio with the distressing response of 'No show is currently scheduled.', that I reached deep inside and clicked about 5 buttons and filled out a few forms, leading to the result you see here before you.A tremendously poor effort at engaging you as a listener by abusing the description of the show as a means of conveying how writing it came about.I guess you get what you pay for.
