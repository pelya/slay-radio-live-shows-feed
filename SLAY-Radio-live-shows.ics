DESCRIPTION:Back from the quite predictable one-week hiatus, I've got quite the talky show in store because there's quite a bit to speak about.So let's see what's on tonight's menu:- The Gathering (obviously)- No Man's Sky (less about the game, more about the politics)- PlanMixPlay future show(s)- FutureHopefully I'll see you there. Who knows, given the lengthy script I've written we might go a little bit over the std. 2 hour broadcast.
