SUMMARY:ziona - Makke-it-happen show!
DESCRIPTION:Hey Slayz0rs! :)Amongst the remixes, originals and demoscene tracks, guess who is going to visit my virtual studio the next Tuesday! Yeah, the guy who did a lot of great tracks, lent his voice to a bunch of remixes, and SLAYRadio signals as well, not to mention he was also leading liveshows in the past here :) He did some of the earliest remixes, what I got my hands on, when I started to listen to them! Please, welcome along with me Makke! =) SLAY tuned!
