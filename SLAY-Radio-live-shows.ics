SUMMARY:ziona - Tuesday of your first or all-time favourites!
DESCRIPTION:Hey all Slayers around! What if that Tuesday everyone would request either one of his/her ALL-TIME favourites ever made, or your FIRST remix / SID / demoscene tune ever, what you fell in love with, maybe even took you here? :) Other requests are also welcomed, but let's try to focus, because I'm curious about your taste, and I'll place my own bets too for some tracks!
