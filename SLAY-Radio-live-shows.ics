SUMMARY:ziona - The Bozzzssspecial!
DESCRIPTION:Dear Slayers,In the upcoming show you can welcome our most prominent, amazing, beautiful, smart, awesome Nobel Prize winning broadcaster (for discovering the DNA of radio)! And he's gonna be my interview guest on air! You can harass him with any questions, and perhaps, maybe, you can learn a lot more about him than in those 12 years of his SLAY Radio career being the Chief Annoyance Officer! ;)Don't forget to prepare your requests too, otherwise we have to play his requests and I won't skip the opportunity to annoy him with his most favourite auto-tuned remix too! SLAY tuuuned! =)
