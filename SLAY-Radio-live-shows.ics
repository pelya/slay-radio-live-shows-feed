SUMMARY:ziona - The If-it-works Show :) 
DESCRIPTION:My soundcard had a near-death experience, but it works again - I wouldn't say it is 100% stable, so in a very few weeks time it has to go to service. Until that time, if dear Scarlett is cooperating with me, I'll try do my best to entertain you with our common beloved earworms!ANYWAY, cross your fingers for Scarlett, so she can serve us well (hopefully not depending on her mood)! :)
