SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - From First to Last (The Contrast remixshow)
DESCRIPTION:Hello Everyone! Have you ever wondered how your favourite remixers started to make their very first pieces? This time, if you tune in, you'll have an opportunity to have a look at the path they walked from their first remix ever to their last ones! I got the idea from the Function demoparty, where they played well-known groups' first and last demos, right after each other, and it gives you a very nice contrast and the discovery that no one was born as a remixer and everyone started somewhere! And Slaygon will join me on this journey, so fun is guaranteed! :) SLAY tuned, and request no songs, but remixers this time! =)
