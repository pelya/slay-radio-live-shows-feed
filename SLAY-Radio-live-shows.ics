SUMMARY:Gazoo - PmpVsEurope
DESCRIPTION:My days here in Europe are drawing to a close, so I thought, let's do one more show for the road.A few more improvements have weaseled their way into PlanMixPlay which I'll yak about. I'll probably have a few words to drop about the holidays as well, but other than that, all I can promise is a fresh set of C-64 related songs to tie you over until it's back to my usual noon-ish timeslot.Be square and be there!
