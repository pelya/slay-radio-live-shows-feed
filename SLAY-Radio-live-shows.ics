SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - Post-Datastorm evening with Jon Hare
DESCRIPTION:Hello Party people, Sofa sceners and SLAYPeeps! We are back after a fantastic weekend at Datastorm, with a lot of great experiences and memories! Cool entries, nice conversations, new friendships and among them, we are proud to say that we had a great time talking with Jon Hare, the famous game designer of several titles like Sensible Soccer, Canon Fodder or Mega Lo Mania. We intend to continue this conversation on air now, so you can learn even more about the veteran game designer and musician! Prepare your requests and ears, SLAY with us for a pleasant post-party evening!
