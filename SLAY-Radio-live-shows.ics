SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsReverseChristmas
DESCRIPTION:It's been a month long hiatus and the time has come to get things moving again here at PlanMixPlay HQ - now located in the city of Melbourne. The world has both changed a lot and barely changed at all. But platitudes aside, here we (You and I) are still focusing on all things C-64.I think it's safe to say that the following items will likely be on the upcoming show:- C-64 Music- Recent PlanMixPlay Developments- C-64 Music- Relocation to Melbourne- C-64 MusicI hope to see you for the official inaugural show. Bare with me if there are any technical difficulties. This will be the first time I do a show from this location/connection/setup etc.
