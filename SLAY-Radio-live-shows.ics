SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsAustralia
DESCRIPTION:G'day Mate, how ya goin' ?It's Sunday across most of the world, and I'm doing whatevz' to do a show for you. A down'n'under show. Crazy right? A new continent. What have I been up to? Well - I've been doing a bit to PlanMixPlay, and soon we might have some video.And when I say soon, I mean not soon, because I'm kind of a moron.If you're still reading, you might as well tune in and listen, cause it'll be way better than the lame jokes you'd find in this text.

SUMMARY:Gurt - Radio Awesome
DESCRIPTION:We're back again for another week! Endure hours of music and prattling Antipodeans, and the only reward you get is bragging rights! It's the usual mumbo jumbo. It's cool, though.
