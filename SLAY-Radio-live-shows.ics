SUMMARY:ziona - Back with a Blaster! 
DESCRIPTION:Hey Everyone! Since Scarlett, the Soundcard got a little sick sometimes, she spends her holiday now in service, meanwhile Brent, the Blaster takes her place, and guess what - we can continue our usual Tuesday fun! Ask for your favourites of original retro-tunes or remixes, and also we will have a secret guest to introduce, just like the last 2 times! Have fun! =)
