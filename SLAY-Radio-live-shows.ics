SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsTestingTheThird
DESCRIPTION:Yes - It's true, and I am as amazed as you are that finally the time has come for the third, and hopefully final, show before the real line-up of shows commences.It seems a bit ludicrous when you consider that my first test show intended to kickstart all my forthcoming shows happened almost 3 months ago now. There's good reason though, tune in and you'll see/hear/find out.Also - a shit ton of new show features to test, too numerous to mention here. Be there, and be square!
