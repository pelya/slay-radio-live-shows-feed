SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - Achtung - MONDAY with Der Danko!
DESCRIPTION:Hi All SLAYfellaz,First time since ziona is doing shows, a Monday will replace a Tuesday evening occasionally, but you can expect the usual show with the special guest star Danko, who did lots, LOTS of SIDs and also he is a professional producer since the '90s. Nowadays he is a member of the Fairlight demogroup as well. Since he is an adopted brother of Slaygon, our beloved Leader will join to co-host the show too :)SLAY tuned with us and request your favourite songs!

SUMMARY:IImmortal vs PhasedBased - Sunday Detox
DESCRIPTION:Hi all,It has been a few years and it took some work and determination to get back again. But with some serious help from PhasedBased we are finally back. I would like to invite you to join us for a lazy Sunday afternoon, feeling the hangover just slip away while we listen to some easy going tunes.
