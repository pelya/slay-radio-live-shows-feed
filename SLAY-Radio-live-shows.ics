SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - And in closing...
DESCRIPTION:... we would like to thank everyone for joining us this year! Let's have a glorious 2020!The year has come to an end, and we will probably speak about what it means to have an orbit that lasts 365ish days. Orbit of the (non-flat) Earth around the Sun, that is.There's also something called Christmas coming up. Apparently some kid was born around this time, but I looked into it, and that seems to be off by like half a year or something at least, so happy April Fools Day everyone!This will, however, conclude the scheduled live shows on SLAY Radio for the year, so make sure to tune in and avoid #whamageddon, because we play none of that!How was your year anyway? Anything good to share? Anything bad? Got #whammed? Share with us! We might even open up the Skype bridge for call-ins for horror stories!SLAY tuned, and we will see where this goes!
