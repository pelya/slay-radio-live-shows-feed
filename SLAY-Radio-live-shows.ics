SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - Post-party mood
DESCRIPTION:Hey Eveyone, The Remix compo has ended and it enriched the scene with a lot of high-quality productions! We are still in awe, and we may have a bit of a chit-chat about this, and some other things as usual. And finally you can request songs again ;)Join in here, on IRC, on Facebook, on YouTube or on Twitch and SLAY tuned! :)
