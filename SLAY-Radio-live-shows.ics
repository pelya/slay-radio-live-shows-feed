SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsYouTube
DESCRIPTION:We've had PMPVsYouTubeCareers, but this time the topic is YouTube itself for a bit. The venture into the visual domain has not been without a few obstacles along the way. There's been a bit of Content ID'ing and some integration hassle. Given that the visual portion of the show is not going away any time soon, it seems like an appropriate thing to talk about at this juncture.So let's take a trip together, back into the the past, some of the present, and perhaps even the future. I promise there'll be some delicious C-64 along the way!See ya'll there!
