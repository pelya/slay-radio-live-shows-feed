SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - Kickstarting the new season
DESCRIPTION:Hello Dear Slayers, We are back on the waves and ready for a fresh start! After Ziona's logistic issues we will be back weekly on air again. We think there will be plenty of scene-related things to talk about amongst your requests, birds are tweeting about upcoming projects and summer/autumn parties, and this will be a new warmup-show for us too. Fasten your seatbelts, sit back, relax and SLAY with us!
