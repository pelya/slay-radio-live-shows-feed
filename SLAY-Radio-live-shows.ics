SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - Unusually Regular Request Show
DESCRIPTION:Hello Our Beloved SLAYPeeps! We think last week we had a really pleasant conversation about sci-fi movies and novels, which unfortunately got lost in the virtual space as a recording, but those who were there seemed to enjoy it. So we were thinking and got to a question: if we could talk so much stupid things if needed, why didn't we ever do a very USUAL, TYPICAL, NORMAL request show which does not have any specified topic or guest? Prepare yourself and your favourite tracks because _this is what we are going to try now_! OK, to make it just a little special you could give us a reason why you love the tune you have picked so much! =) Grab a drink, sit back, relax and enjoy SLAYing with us!
