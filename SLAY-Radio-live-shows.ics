SUMMARY:Gazoo - PMPVsFanInfringement
DESCRIPTION:Hello Internet people,Hopefully you're all doing well. Apologies for the recent hiatus, there's been a lot to do these past weekends and there'll likely be quite a bit more in the future. Hopefully I'll be able to settle in to a periodic rhythm in the near future, but until then, I'm afraid the sporadic shows will have to suffice.This weeks show will be a bit about fan games and the consequences of embarking on them without proper clearance. Also - C64 fun as usual!Be there and be a square!
