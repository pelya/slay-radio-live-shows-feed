SUMMARY:KraxxUltima - The In-Between Show
DESCRIPTION:So ...It's soon Midsummer, and its very dry and hot for the season , well in 2 weeks but that's insignificant. Welcome aboard the Unsinkable Ship once again... We try our best to steer clear of any dangers I do not provide myself m of any of my shipmates.  Why don't ya tune in and request lots of Commodore tunes , original or remixes won't matter, We need them to stay afloat in the hostile waters ahead , as it were :P(Note... We start 2 hours earlier than normal this time !)
