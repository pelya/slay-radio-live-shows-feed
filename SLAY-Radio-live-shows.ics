SUMMARY:ziona and Slaygon - FastLoaders rocking Amiga
DESCRIPTION:Hi Everyone, A special edition show is ahead, since we will have FastLoaders chatting with us about their newly baked Kickstarter project, Amiga Rocks - over 30 tracks of Amiga gems with precious guitars! Join the discussion, ask your questions and get a feel of the albums - we will surely play a bunch of tracks, so the evening will rock as well after the warmup hour with requests! SLAY tuned!
