Collect all remixes you like with singing in them, hum with us and fill our evening with melodies and joy! \n\nOur only rule for the evening is that the songs should include some sort of vocals. \n\nAlso, don't forget that we are shifting days soon but haven't completely settled yet! It appears Thursday gets most of the votes, but it will still take some time to shift entirely because first part of June will be full of events for us! \n\nSo come along and share your thoughts on your favourite vocal tracks, Tuesday vs Thursday and above all - SLAY tuned with us! \n","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>This is not the Eurovision","nice_airdate":"Thursday 23rd May, 2019<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
