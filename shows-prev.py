He got all my computers in my child and teenagehood in fact. His non-stop optimism was cheering up everyone around him. Without him I would not be who I am, and I would not be wherever I am right now. \n\nThere won't be any concept, just a free-flow show, as it is, and we will see, where it goes. \n\nTake care! \n\n\/ziona\n\n","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>Logging in again","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 19th June, 2018<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"},{"show_ID":"2065","airdate":"1529517600","name_switch":"off","DJ":"Boz","showname":"BBB","blurb":"Boz returns for a BBB after hanging up his keys for a while.
