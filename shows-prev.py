Jingle bells everywhere, and most of us are probably a little fed up with all the christmas songs you can hear on the streets or in the shopping malls. \n\nThis is why we have the cure for you, at least for an evening: the metal-remix show, which can help your frustration or just helps you to relax a little. \n\nPlease, request metal remixes only this time regardless if it is C64 or Amiga, let the guitars rock for the entire evening! We are looking forward to hear from you and your choice of tracks! \n\nSLAY tuned! ;)","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>The Metallic Show","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 4th December, 2018<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
