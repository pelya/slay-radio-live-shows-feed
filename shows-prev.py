This way, if some people might miss our Fb warning, still they can get a reminder. Also, Flashparty, the only demoparty in South America just happened over the weekend, and the lovely people played SLAY Radio there when there weren't any events happening, so we show some of the compo releases from their mp3 and oldschool music compo as well! \n\nJoin us at any of our channels, share your experiences with us if you were there and SLAY tuned! :) ","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>Tuesday broad(er)cast","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 25th September, 2018<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"},{"show_ID":"2094","airdate":"1538301600","name_switch":"off","DJ":"Gazoo","showname":"PMPVsTestingTheFourth","blurb":"And the void opened, and out peered a solitary show.\n\nBe there and be a square sine-wave.","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PMPVsTestingTheFourth","nice_airdate":"Sunday 30th September, 2018<br \/>at 12:00 USRT"}]}
