Don't worry, you have a life-time supply of battery power that will only power your mp3 player, so you're safe!\nSo we want you to name and request your all-time favourite C64-or Amigaremixes! (both can be C64 or Amiga - the choice is yours!)\n\nGo ahead, think it through carefully and choose! We can't wait to hear your own personal TOP2! :) \n\nJoin the fun and SLAY tuned! \n","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>The TOP2 Challenge","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 22nd January, 2019<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
