Okay, it's been only 2 weeks. But now we are back, and we picked a favourite topic of ours for this Tuesday, which most of you might be interested too - Sci-Fi!\n\nSo we might talk about movies, series, books and even games related to that (in the latter we have less experience, but who knows - for example I like Space invaders - ziona :)\n\nAnd you can request your favourite remixes as well (also, there are plenty of them out there related to space games, but you can ask for anything this time ;)\n\nMake some space in your calendar and come SLAY along with us!\n","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>Sci-fi Tuesday","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 17th April, 2018<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
