No genre specified this time, so it can be anything from comedy to science fiction to silent movies!\n\nAs always, the Request-o-Tron 3000 will be open, so place your remix or SID wishes there and we just might play them!\n\nJoin us in the conversation in the usual locations! SLAY tuned!","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>The Movie Challenge Show","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 27th November, 2018<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"},{"show_ID":"2125","airdate":"1543741200","name_switch":"off","DJ":"Gazoo","showname":"PmpVsPartialComebackTrilogy-PartTwo","blurb":"We're closing in on the extended holiday period of the year, and with that, I'll be doing a couple of more shows. Possibly even some over the holidays.\n\nThere's been a bit more work occurring behind the scenes - mostly related to the automated show announcements behind the scenes. With a little luck, there'll only be one or two bugs affecting the now revived show announcement via Twitter.\n\nEither way, if you'd like yet another way to know when there's a show from me, then you should follow @PlanMixPlay on Twitter. (When working as intended) it'll tweet whenever a new show is announced (which also happens via Slay's RSS), and it'll also tweet 60, 15, and 5 minutes up to a show commencing (not happening via Slay's RSS).\n\nIt'll likely be a fairly run-of-the-mill show to further narrow down bugs and possibly test one or two new features all while revelling in the magic that is C64 music :)\n\nSee you there!","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PmpVsPartialComebackTrilogy-PartTwo","nice_airdate":"Sunday 2nd December, 2018<br \/>at 10:00 USRT"}]}
