A whole two shows from PlanMixPlay and me, and one of them scheduled more than a week in advance! Gasp!\n\nTo heighten the excitement, the shows will not only be far apart in a time sense, but also spatially. 16,175.76 km to be exact. While it does mean the visual portion is a little in question for the second part, being I'm not too sure of the upstream in the second location, it may just end up being a classic 'Audio only' show. Who can say? Time will tell!\n\nTune in to hear a bit about the Fallout franchise, some Immortal and PhasedBased stuff, and whatever else comes to mind at the time!\n\nSee you there and stay square!\n\nGazoo","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PmpVsXMas Part Two of Two","nice_airdate":"Sunday 16th December, 2018<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
