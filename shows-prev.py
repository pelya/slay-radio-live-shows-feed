Since both of our birthdays are approaching, both of us will send you a TCP packet and a virtual slice of cake!\n\nAnd daXX provided a special gift for ziona: she can pick which track he should remix next! We will announce her choice as well during the show. \n\nOf course, a party is not a party without your requests, so please feel free to send them as well! \n\nJoin us and SLAY tuned, yay!","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>Pre-birthday party","nice_airdate":"Thursday 11th June, 2020<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
