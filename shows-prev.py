Jingle bells everywhere, and most of us are probably a little fed up with all the Christmas songs you hear on the streets or in the shopping malls. \n\nThis is why we have the cure for you, at least for an evening: the metal remix show, which can help your frustration or just help you to relax a little. \n\nPlease, request metal remixes only this time, be it C64 or Amiga, let the guitars rock for the entire evening! We are looking forward to hear from you and your choice of tracks! \n\nSLAY tuned! ;)","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>The Metallic Show","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 4th December, 2018<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"},{"show_ID":"2129","airdate":"1544122800","name_switch":"off","DJ":"KraxxUltima","showname":"The Ultimate Snowy Winter","blurb":"Just like good old times , like the perfect winter should be ...white cold crystals everywhere..to remind us of how nice summer would be in contrast. Anyway , come on in and warm yourselves up and listen, also request nice remixes to yer captain Kraxx ..for there's some nice tunes to plow through because of recent submissions.
