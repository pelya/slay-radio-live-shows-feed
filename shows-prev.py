Fortunately, Slaygon and Ziona have generally been picking up the slack.\n\nThe good news - hopefully - is that this show will be choc-full of a one or two new features. Given that they're not complete and that announcing this show is partially an intentional self-motivator on my behalf, I'd rather not note what exactly the show will feature. All the more reason to tune in and find out ;)\n\nI'll be talking quite a bit about how I put my foot in my mouth in a few social situations as well as playing the usual plethora of C-64 game tunez.","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PmpVsMassiveComebackSpecial","nice_airdate":"Sunday 28th July, 2019<br \/>at 12:00 USRT"}]}
