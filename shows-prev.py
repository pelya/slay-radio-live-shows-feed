So you will. See? Simple.\n\nIn addition, to that, here's a little taste of the menu:\n\n- Classic SID remixes\n- One of a kind c-64 live style chat\n- The realities of rental life\n- PlanMixPlay moving forward\n- Neir: Automata\n- Various minor topics\n- Possibly (hopefully) the big finale I've been promising for a while\n\nFor those wondering upfront - it is going to be a solo show which means you get 100% unadulterated me.","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PMPVsTestingTheFifth","nice_airdate":"Sunday 21st October, 2018<br \/>at 11:00 USRT"}]}
