You'll have an opportunity to figure this out, because we certainly will have questions for her that she might never answered on air before :)\n\nSo, we are really excited to welcome the Gothic Lady of the Remix Scene, the Musician and the Gamer: K8-bit!\n\nPrepare your requests and questions and SLAY tuned, and remember - ASCII stupid question, get a stupid ANSI! =)","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>K8-bits and pieces","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 18th December, 2018<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"},{"show_ID":"2135","airdate":"1545505200","name_switch":"off","DJ":"Gazoo","showname":"PmpVs2018","blurb":"This is it. The ultimate show in the year 2018 for me.\n\nWhat will 2019 bring? Tune in and find out... that I don't know what 2019 will bring.

That I didn't bring my \"more professional than me\" microphone half-way around the globe to just sit and gather dust on the floor.\n\nNo. It's too good for that, and damn it so am I. So there will be another show in the Europe evening time, and likely another one or two in 2019. Damn it, now I ended up making predictions after all.\n\nSomebody stop me!","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PmpVs2018","nice_airdate":"Saturday 22nd December, 2018<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
