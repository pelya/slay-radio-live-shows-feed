If that sounds odd, allow me to yield some insight:\n\n- An inherent trait of the PMPVs show, is that it's broadcast using PlanMixPlay (PMP - look it up at www.planmixplay.com)\n- PMP is best described as prototype (pre-alpha) software.\n- The resources available for developing PMP are fairly scarce. In fact - they largely comprise one person.\n- These resources are primarily focused on adding new features.\n- Every new feature will always come with bugs and require a significant amount of work to stabilize.\n- Given the aforementioned limited resources, properly stabilizing features will likely not be a priority for a while.\n- Thus PMP will, for the foreseeable future, be primarily ever-evolving and fairly unstable.\n\nThat being said - an effort is made to ensure that the issues exhibited by PMP during a live broadcast are limited.\n\nFrequent listeners will know that occasionally, problems still worm their way through.\n\nBut given that PMP has gone through a recent stabilization phase again (following loads of new features), I think now's as good a time as any to stop calling the shows testing shows.\n\nI hope you'll join me, possibly returning Danish guest-host, and the gang on Sunday for some C-64 tunes and silliness!","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PmpVsPartialComebackTrilogy-PartOne","nice_airdate":"Sunday 4th November, 2018<br \/>at 10:00 USRT"}]}
