And if you feel like it, explain why.\n\nAlso, we have 2 last-minute tickets for the concert in Hull, and due to the short notice we won\u2019t have a puzzle this time, but if someone is interested, please provide us a good reason why the ticket(s) should be yours. The best reasoning wins!\n\nWarm up with us and SLAY tuned!","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>Epic warmup","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 11th June, 2019<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
