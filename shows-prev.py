This is what we will talk about a bit today. Any of you who feels similar, can enter the game and share the colors of the tracks we play - ziona certainly will. \n\nThese experiences are usually unique and no one hears\/sees these colors the same way, this is why it can be even more interesting :) \n\nLooking forward to hear your impressions! Join us and SLAY tuned!   ","nice_showname":"<strong>Synth-estesia?<\/strong> with ziona and Slaygon","nice_airdate":"Thursday 20th May, 2021<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
