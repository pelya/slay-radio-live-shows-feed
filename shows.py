The world has both changed a lot and barely changed at all. But platitudes aside, here we (You and I) are still focusing on all things C-64.\n\nI think it's safe to say that the following items will likely be on the upcoming show:\n\n- C-64 Music\n- Recent PlanMixPlay Developments\n- C-64 Music\n- Relocation to Melbourne\n- C-64 Music\n\nI hope to see you for the official inaugural show. Bare with me if there are any technical difficulties. This will be the first time I do a show from this location\/connection\/setup etc.","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PMPVsReverseChristmas","nice_airdate":"Wednesday 7th December, 2016<br \/>at 11:00 USRT"},{"show_ID":"1830","airdate":"1481137200","name_switch":"off","DJ":"Bozzy and the Bint","showname":"BBKB","blurb":"It's the Taint of the Week\u2122 again, so it's time for Boz to utter complete bollocks in between your requests.
