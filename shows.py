Well, since this show is being announced, way, way, waaaay, in advance (which is quite uncommon for PMP shows as you may know), there isn't going to be much in the way of predictions for topics. I do have one single thing I'll throw in there:\n\n- Multi-player only games that have no player base within... months?\n- Feature 1\n- Feature 2\n\nI dare not put more stuff in here in regards to feature 1 and 2, as deadlines have a habit of never really working out. But let's see we go this time.\n\nSee you at the show!","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PMPVsDoubleFeature","nice_airdate":"Sunday 19th February, 2017<br \/>at 10:00 USRT"},{"show_ID":"1861","airdate":"1487530800","name_switch":"off","DJ":"Remix64.com","showname":"Remixer of the Year Awards 2016","blurb":"The time has come to celebrate and acknowledge the remixers' work in the C64 community by presenting the yearly ROTY Awards, as voted by the users at www.rexmi64.com.
