Yes. It's often misquoted as \"I'll be back\", a common misconception.\n\nMy excursion to the north has ended prematurely, which is a little sad given that it means I will\/am not attending the Gathering, but to make up for it in my own little way, I will be closing out the weekend of the Gathering with a show. This time at a much later slot.\n\nThis of course does put the show a bit out of listening range from the previous continent I broadcast from, and yes - I am counting Asia as a separate content, despite the fact that it is a landmass connected to Europe.\n\nSo tune in, or don't, either way, there are a few surprises on the way. Mainly, a little improved chat system that will hopefully keep improving as time goes on.","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PMPVsHamburg","nice_airdate":"Sunday 2nd August, 2015<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
