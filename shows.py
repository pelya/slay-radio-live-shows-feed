Hope everyone made it safely through Halloween, and that the kids didn't terrorize you too much with their demands for candy, tricks and other nonsense.  Anyway ,Kraxx shall soothe any eventual wounds this autumn causes by causing more. Well, in musical form anyhow.\nMake your Commodore requests and listen to a semi-normal swedish northlander talking in between da songs ;)","nice_showname":"<strong><big>KraxxUltima<\/big><\/strong><br \/>The Ultimate Crack","nice_airdate":"Thursday 5th November, 2015<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"},{"show_ID":"1671","airdate":"1446836400","name_switch":"off","DJ":"Gurt","showname":"Radio Awesome","blurb":"I'm back from holiday, so it's time to inflict another show on people!

Huh? Who? Gazoo?\n\nYes. I've been off the air for the past 2 months. Not necessarily happy about that, but sometimes life gets in the way and in this case, a particularly curious situation stopped me from broadcasting. Was it dingos chewing on the cable? Kangaroos boxing me out of house and home? Do not fret - all will be revealed this Sunday.\n\nWell... Most things will. Ok - some things. Alright fine, one or two tiny tid-bits may. Perhaps. Possibly. If you're lucky.\n\nBut I should be so lucky! Spend the Sunday evening with me - and I'll tell you all about the exciting future! I promise, I'll play some tunes too!","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PMPVsHamburg","nice_airdate":"Sunday 8th November, 2015<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
