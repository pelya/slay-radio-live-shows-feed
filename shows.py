It's nearly 2016. And I'm living with my parents. While doing a Commodore 64 themed show in the basement. By most standards, this would be classified as 'not the means to an end', but the actual 'end' itself. Seriously...\n\nBut while I'm writing this here, a part of me wonders who even bothers reading these texts. More importantly, why do I bother writing them? I mean, even big-time shows like old Tonight show, or as I like to call it 'The Conan 'o Brian show hosted by Jay Leno' (heh) probably had this text that nobody read. Written by an intern. While on the way to pick up breakfast. For another intern.\n\nSeriously, I'm cranking out A-grade material here, and when will it be blessed by living eyes?
