We gonna dedicate an entire show to the remixes made of Last Ninja series, but do not be afraid - it doesn't mean we gonna play the same melodies for an hour =) We go subtune by subtune in order of the SIDs, and pick one excellent remix of each of them, from Last Ninja 1 to 4, if time will be on our side (if it takes longer than three hours, well... we consider to do a second take of it later :) \n\nJoin us, and if you request, please, ask for your favourite Last Ninja tune this time! Again - we play one of each subtunes. So it might be yours =) SLAY tuned!
