And guess, what happened at Easter weekend - one of the biggest demoscene party took place at Germany, called Revision 2017! The guys who have been there said, it was amazing, and the competition releases were also very high-end! So I'll introduce you some of those. And the blurb is not over yet, since we'll have a guest this week, whose name is also very well-known at the remix scene as a musician, and he is member of more bands as well - I am looking forward to interview him! SLAY tuned! =)","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona<\/big><\/strong><br \/>Tuesday Fun with bits of Re-vision","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 18th April, 2017<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"},{"show_ID":"1898","airdate":"1492624800","name_switch":"off","DJ":"Bozzy and the Bint","showname":"BBKB","blurb":"It's the Taint of the Week\u2122 again, so it's time for Boz to utter complete bollocks in between your requests.
