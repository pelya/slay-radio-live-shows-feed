This time, if you tune in, you'll have an opportunity to have a look at the path they walked from their first remix ever to their last ones! \n\nI got the idea from the Function demoparty, where they played well-known groups' first and last demos, right after each other, and it gives you a very nice contrast and the discovery that no one was born as a remixer and everyone started somewhere! \n\nAnd Slaygon will join me on this journey, so fun is guaranteed! :) \n\nSLAY tuned, and request no songs, but remixers this time! =)","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>From First to Last (The Contrast remixshow)","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 3rd October, 2017<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
