Even though she almost had a heart attack pressing the button at the start, she enjoyed to play her blippy-bloppy things very much, so she kept going on Tuesdays after this beautiful evening. Later on she figured she feels too boring alone on air so she started to dig up people on the remix scene for interviews. After passively observing the scene for 13 years, having conversation with all those people who did the beloved tracks seemed like another dream come true for Ziona. \n\nSlaygon silently followed the events in the background providing tech support when it was needed, till the moment they figured out there are undeniable vibes ringing between them. So here we go, welcome to Ziona's Anniversary Show with maybe Slaygon, if he's not gonna be too tired to join! :)  \n\nThank you so much everyone for being with me this beautiful year! <3\n\n","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona and maybe Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>The Anniversary Show","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 9th January, 2018<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"},{"show_ID":"2018","airdate":"1515610800","name_switch":"off","DJ":"Bozzy and the Bint","showname":"BBKB","blurb":"It's the start of the year WOO-HOO!
