I trust you will excuse the somewhat messy transition, as long as there's a show or two to hold you over.\n\nSpeaking of hold over shows - this would be one of those. There's no current agenda as such, but if I manage I'll be sure to squeeze in the time to write up a script. No promises though.\n\nHope to see you on Sunday!","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PMPVsMusitec","nice_airdate":"Sunday 25th September, 2016<br \/>at 12:30 USRT"}]}
