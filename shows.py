I would say the past few weeks with PlanMixPlay certainly add more to the proof pile for this rule of thumb. I've had some features in mind that have seemingly been on the way for ages now. While every show inches closer, I still don't dare to guarantee anything this time around.\n\nSo instead of me meandering on about what may or may not happen, here are some sure definites:\n\n- C64 Remixes\n- Banter\/Ranter\n\nJoin me for perhaps what will or will not be a very notable episode. I can say this for certain, it will definitely be a show!","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PMPVsDeadlines","nice_airdate":"Sunday 26th February, 2017<br \/>at 10:00 USRT"}]}
