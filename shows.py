And he's gonna be my interview guest on air! You can harass him with any questions, and perhaps, maybe, you can learn a lot more about him than in those 12 years of his SLAY Radio career being the Chief Annoyance Officer! ;)\nDon't forget to prepare your requests too, otherwise we have to play his requests and I won't skip the opportunity to annoy him with his most favourite auto-tuned remix too! \n\nSLAY tuuuned! =)","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona<\/big><\/strong><br \/>The Bozzzssspecial!","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 26th September, 2017<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"},{"show_ID":"1971","airdate":"1506535200","name_switch":"off","DJ":"Bozzy and the Bint","showname":"BBKB","blurb":"It's the Taint of the Week\u2122 again, so it's time for Boz to utter complete bollocks in between your requests.

This time, if you tune in, you'll have an opportunity to have a look at the path they walked from their first remix ever to their last ones! \n\nI got the idea from the Function demoparty, where they played well-known groups' first and last demos, right after each other, and it gives you a very nice contrast and the discovery that no one was born as a remixer and everyone started somewhere! \n\nAnd Slaygon will join me on this journey, so fun is guaranteed! :) \n\nSLAY tuned, and request no songs, but remixers this time! =)","nice_showname":"<strong><big>ziona & Slaygon<\/big><\/strong><br \/>From First to Last (The Contrast remixshow)","nice_airdate":"Tuesday 3rd October, 2017<br \/>at 20:00 USRT"}]}
