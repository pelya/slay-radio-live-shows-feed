The keen observer may have noticed that some of the start times just didn't seem to mesh with reality.\n\nWell fear not my number concerned companion. The nasty non-accurate numbers are no more!\n\nIn other news I hunkered down this week and cut a teaser\/promo for PlanMixPlay. I'll talk a bit about it, but I'll also be sure to try my best to have something better to talk about. Like how not to lead your younger fans to a life of gambling.
