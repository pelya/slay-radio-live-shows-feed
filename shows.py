Hallo fine esteemed gentlemans and gentleladys.\n\nYou might have noticed a slight change in show name. No, I haven't left Australia, so I'm still very much Vs. with Australia, but I've recently made one of the best decisions ever by actually investing a little bit of money in myself and PMP. \n\nIn other words, I now officially have a small development space dedicated to PlanMixPlay at Majoran Distilleries. I'll be spending a few months polishing up PlanMixPlay and getting it to the next important milestone.\n\nWith a little luck, I may get to do a show on the re-vamped version here in Australia. Fingers crossed!\n\nAnyway - This blurb was supposed to be about the show - so uhm. It's a C-64 show. Listen to it. This text commands you to.","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PMPVsMajoran","nice_airdate":"Sunday 20th September, 2015<br \/>at 13:30 USRT"},{"show_ID":"1644","airdate":"1442944800","name_switch":"off","DJ":"Gohanks","showname":"Retro For Sure","blurb":"Well the week is starting to fill up with shows quite regularly now, so I won't be one to dissapoint!
