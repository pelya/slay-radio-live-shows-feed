Apologies for the recent hiatus, there's been a lot to do these past weekends and there'll likely be quite a bit more in the future. Hopefully I'll be able to settle in to a periodic rhythm in the near future, but until then, I'm afraid the sporadic shows will have to suffice.\n\nThis weeks show will be a bit about fan games and the consequences of embarking on them without proper clearance. Also - C64 fun as usual!\n\nBe there and be a square!","nice_showname":"<strong><big>Gazoo<\/big><\/strong><br \/>PMPVsFanInfringement","nice_airdate":"Sunday 30th April, 2017<br \/>at 12:00 USRT"}]}
